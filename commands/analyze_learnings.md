Analyze learnings and journal entries to identify improvement opportunities.

Use the meta-insights skill to:
1. Find unanalyzed entries in ~/docs/claude-learnings/ and ~/docs/claude-journal/
2. Detect cross-cutting themes across all repositories
3. Present findings with actionable recommendations
4. Generate implementation prompts for approved actions

Save prompts to ~/docs/claude-meta-insights/actions/<timestamp>/ for execution in fresh sessions.
