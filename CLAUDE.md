# Development Guidelines

This file contains universal development principles and patterns that apply across all projects. Project-specific workflows, tech stacks, and gotchas belong in individual project CLAUDE.md files.

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Process

### 1. Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]

**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```

- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### 2. Implementation Flow

1. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
2. **Test** - Write test first (red)
3. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing
5. **Commit** - With clear message linking to plan

### 3. When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when possible** - Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests
  - Include tests for new functionality
  - Follow project formatting/linting

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

## Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

### Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Subagent Delegation Rules

### Mandatory Subagent Operations

**CRITICAL**: When operating as a main/coordinating agent, you are a **coordinator only**. ALL execution work MUST be delegated to subagents.

| Operation                         | Delegate To                         | Rationale                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ANY `mcp__playwright__*` call** | `typescript-tester` or similar      | Browser automation requires focused context and isolated execution |
| **Code edits (Read/Edit/Write)**  | `general-purpose` or phase-specific | Isolates implementation from coordination, enables parallel work   |
| **File reading**                  | `general-purpose` or `Explore`      | Main agent should not read code files directly                     |
| **Codebase exploration**          | `Explore`                           | Efficient pattern searching without polluting main context         |
| **Test execution**                | `typescript-tester` or similar      | Test runs need isolation to handle output and iterate on failures  |
| **ANY implementation work**       | `general-purpose`                   | Main agent coordinates, subagents execute                          |

**⚠️ MAIN AGENT: EXPLORATION, IMPLEMENTATION, OR EXECUTION = SUBAGENT. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

This rule applies to the **main/coordinating agent only**. Subagents (like `typescript-tester`) **SHOULD** use tools directly — that's their job.

### Main Agent Must NOT Directly Call

- `Read`, `Edit`, `Write` tools on code files
- `Glob`, `Grep` for codebase exploration
- `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`
- `browser_snapshot`, `browser_take_screenshot`
- `browser_resize`, `browser_close`
- ANY other Playwright MCP tool
- ANY bash commands that execute code or tests

### It Does NOT Matter If You Call It

- "Quick file read" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Just checking one thing" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Quick verification" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Manual testing" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Just checking if it works" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Taking a screenshot" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT
- "Small edit" ← STILL NEEDS SUBAGENT

**Main agent: If you're about to explore, implement, or execute → STOP → Use a subagent instead.**

**Subagents: You ARE the delegated executor. Use tools directly to complete your task.**

### Why Subagents for ALL Execution

- **Context isolation**: Keeps main conversation focused on coordination
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple subagents can work concurrently
- **Failure containment**: Subagent errors don't derail main session
- **Cleaner history**: Detailed tool calls stay in subagent context
- **Scalability**: Main agent can coordinate many subagents without context bloat
- **Specialization**: Each subagent type is optimized for its task

### Subagent Permissions and Prompt Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Subagents have DIFFERENT permissions than the main agent. When spawning a subagent, you MUST include context about what the subagent can do:

**Always include in subagent prompts:**

```
You are a subagent (not the main coordinating agent). As a subagent, you CAN and SHOULD:
- Call mcp__playwright__* tools directly (browser automation is YOUR job)
- Execute bash commands that the main agent delegates to you
- Make code edits directly
- Run tests and handle their output
```

**Why this matters:**

- Main agent restrictions (like "don't call Playwright directly") do NOT apply to subagents
- Subagents are the delegated executors - they DO the work the main agent coordinates
- Without this context, subagents may incorrectly refuse to perform their core functions

### Main Agent vs. Subagent Responsibilities

| Main Agent (Coordinator)            | Subagent (Executor)                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Communicate with user               | Read/write ANY files               |
| Plan strategy                       | Explore codebase (`Glob`, `Grep`)  |
| Present options to user             | Execute code changes               |
| Coordinate subagent tasks           | **ANY `mcp__playwright__*` call**  |
| Summarize subagent results          | Execute unit/integration/e2e tests |
| Run project commands/slash commands | Debug and fix errors               |
| Read tracking docs (if project has) | Write/edit tracking docs           |

**🚫 NEVER in Main Agent:** File reads, file writes, codebase exploration, test execution, browser automation

**✅ Main agent CAN directly:**

- Run simple git commands (`git status`, `git log`, `git diff`)
- Read project tracking/documentation files (to understand current state)
- Communicate with user
- Spawn and coordinate subagents

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers

### Test Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic

## Important Reminders

**NEVER**:

- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code

**ALWAYS**:

- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
- Delegate all execution work to subagents (when operating as main agent)
